- [x] listening to the user's input and assigning it to the URL query
- [x] Figure out a performant way to handle the search logic
- [x] Update the fetch query and the UI accordingly
- [x] First try of understanding default export VS just export FAILED! do some research
- [x] Empty the input value after fetch
- [x] use react-query to fetch, add cache, and extand the application functionalities
- [x] Extract the codebase and props handling
- [x] You know, underline the home buttons on hover or some shit

- [x] Implement "ENTER" handleKeyPress() on button
- [x] Create some cool animation and better overall UX and UI Design
- [x] Create a fun favicon
- [x] Lazyload GIFs, note: i've implemented it with [react-lazy](https://github.com/Aljullu/react-lazy-load-image-component)
- [ ] Implement SEO best practices
- [ ] Work on the responsiveness media queries file and brush up on the Net Ninja series
- [ ] convert fetch searched GIFs to use React-query as well (analyze the diff between it & Fetch API)
- [ ] Extract Styles in dedicated files, maybe even a SASS conversion, since it is installed
- [ ] Deploy the application and try the performance in production
      (keep in mind => transition, animation, and overall app performance);
- [ ] I might as well create a performant component library and push it npm

```
* What's on my mind, when the app renders the content animates to the center, then
- Lazy load GIF cards
- the user focuses the input, the container pops up and the backgrounds blurs,
- the user clicks Search, the div slides up and the cards kinda like slide in animat
```
